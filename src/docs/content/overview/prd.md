# Hivemind — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Vision

Hivemind is a **local-first, observable orchestration system for agentic software development**.

It enables solo developers to manage projects, tasks, and automated agent workflows with the same rigor, safety, and transparency as high-performing engineering teams — without surrendering control to opaque AI behavior.

Hivemind prioritizes:

- **Truth through observability**
- **Explicit structure over implicit magic**
- **Human authority at every critical boundary**

---

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals

- Enable safe parallel agent execution on real codebases
- Make agent behavior observable, inspectable, and debuggable
- Support both lightweight task tracking and heavyweight automated workflows
- Work entirely **locally** using existing CLI-based agent runtimes

### Non-Goals (v0.x)

- Hosting or training models
- Cloud-first execution
- Fully autonomous code merging by default

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Project

A **Project** is the top-level organizational unit in Hivemind.

- Defined and owned by Hivemind (not Git)
- Represents a logical body of work
- May reference **one or many Git repositories**
- Holds:
  - Tasks
  - TaskFlows
  - Documentation and context
  - Automations

Projects are defined in a **Hivemind project registry** outside of any repository.

---

### 3.2 Repository

A **Repository** is a versioned code source (e.g. Git).

- Repositories may belong to **multiple projects**
- Project–repository relationships are explicit
- Each project defines its own access mode (read-only / read-write)

Repositories are inputs to Hivemind, not owners of orchestration state.

---

### 3.3 Task

A **Task** is a unit of intent.

- May exist without automation
- May be tracked as a simple todo
- May optionally be executed by agents

A task with no assigned agent has **no execution semantics**.

---

### 3.4 TaskFlow

A **TaskFlow** is an optional, heavyweight execution construct.

It is:

- A deterministic, executable document
- A DAG of tasks and dependencies
- Fully observable, pausable, and replayable

TaskFlow is used when guarantees are required:

- Parallel agents
- Verification and retries
- Auditability and recovery

---

### 3.5 Agents

Agents are execution actors with explicit roles:

- **Planner Agent** — creates tasks, dependencies, and scopes (outside execution)
- **Worker Agent** — performs task execution
- **Verifier Agent** — evaluates correctness and completion
- **Merge Agent** — prepares and governs integration (optional)
- **Freeflow Agent** — unscoped, non-project conversational agent

Agents:

- Never own state
- Never decide structure mid-execution
- Always operate within explicit constraints

---

### 3.6 Scope

A **Scope** is a capability contract between an agent and a project.

Scopes define:

- Filesystem read/write permissions
- Execution permissions
- Git permissions

Scopes are:

- Declared before execution
- Enforced during execution
- Verified after execution

Scopes enable safe parallelism and clear accountability.

---

### 3.7 Worktrees

Worktrees are ephemeral execution surfaces.

- Created per task and per repository
- Isolated when required by scope conflicts
- Shared only when explicitly safe

Worktrees are a consequence of scopes, not a primary abstraction.

---

## 4. Execution Model

### 4.1 Planning Phase (Outside Execution)

- Planner agent converts intent into:
  - Tasks
  - Dependencies
  - Scopes
- Output is an **immutable TaskFlow plan**

Once execution begins, the planner exits.

---

### 4.2 TaskFlow Execution

Each task follows a bounded execution lifecycle:

```
WAITING → RUNNING → VERIFYING → { SUCCESS | RETRY | FAILED }
```

- Tasks execute when dependencies are satisfied
- Parallelism is governed by scope compatibility

#### Execution Surface Ownership

During task execution, the execution surface (branch and worktree) is **owned by the TaskFlow engine**.

- Agent-driven changes are the only permitted mutations
- Human edits must occur outside active execution branches
- Interleaving human and agent edits on the same execution surface is not supported by default

Violations result in explicit failure or escalation.

---

### 4.3 Verification Loop

When a task completes:

1. Automated checks run (tests, linters, etc.)
2. Verifier agent evaluates:
   - Diffs
   - Check results
   - Natural language criteria

Verifier outcomes:

- **PASS** — task completes
- **SOFT FAIL** — worker recalled with instructions
- **HARD FAIL** — task aborted

Retry limits and escalation authority are configurable per task.

---

### 4.4 Execution Artifacts

Task execution produces explicit, inspectable artifacts:

- Task-owned execution branches
- Checkpoint (execution) commits
- Attributable diffs

Execution commits are ephemeral and never merged directly.

Final integration commits are created only via the merge protocol.

---

### 4.5 Merge Protocol

Merging is **explicit and separate from execution**.

Defaults:

- No automatic merge
- Human approval required

Optional:

- Merge agent may prepare pull requests
- Auto-merge may be enabled per project or task

---

## 5. Observability

Observability is a first-class requirement.

Hivemind records:

- Agent actions
- Task and TaskFlow state transitions
- Scope conflicts and violations
- Diffs and file changes
- Verification outcomes

Agents emit **structured execution events**, not free-form status updates.

System status is derived from observable facts, not narrative progress reports.

All execution is replayable and auditable.

---

## 6. Runtime Strategy

Hivemind is **CLI-first**.

- Uses existing agent runtimes:
  - Claude Code
  - OpenCode
  - Codex CLI
  - Gemini CLI
- Hivemind wraps and constrains these tools
- Runtime configuration is abstracted behind Hivemind

Native runtime support may be added later without changing execution semantics.

---

## 7. Storage & Source of Truth

- Projects, TaskFlows, and orchestration state are owned by Hivemind
- Code remains owned by Git
- Hivemind artifacts may be stored:
  - In a central local registry
  - And/or mirrored into repositories for portability

There is no hidden state.

---

## 8. UI & UX Principles

- CLI is the authoritative interface
- All functionality is exposed via the CLI
- UI is a projection of system state

Interactive execution is treated as a transport problem:

- Runtimes are external interactive processes (stdin/stdout)
- The CLI may optionally relay interactive runtime IO while emitting events
- Any chat-like UI is a projection over those events and capabilities, not an alternative control plane

Chat transcripts are not state. **Events are state.**

Because of this, agents may operate **Hivemind itself** for automation, recovery, and meta-orchestration.

Key views:

- Project overview
- Task list / Kanban
- TaskFlow document view
- Dependency graph
- Diff and verification views

TaskFlows may be viewed as living documents (similar to sprint plans).

---

## 9. User Stories

### US1: Simple Todo Tracking

A user creates tasks in a project with no agents attached. Tasks behave as a standard todo list.

---

### US2: Manual Agent Assistance

A user runs a worker agent on a single task, reviews diffs, and manually applies changes.

---

### US3: Structured TaskFlow

A user creates a TaskFlow with multiple tasks, dependencies, and verification, and runs it end-to-end.

---

### US4: Verification Failure & Retry

A verifier detects failure, recalls the worker with instructions, and retries until success or abort.

---

### US5: Parallel Scoped Agents

Multiple agents run in parallel on the same repository with non-overlapping scopes.

---

### US6: Scope Conflict Handling

Overlapping write scopes trigger warnings and optional worktree isolation.

---

### US7: Multi-Repo Project Execution

A TaskFlow safely orchestrates changes across backend and frontend repositories.

---

### US8: Shared Repo Across Projects

A shared repository is used read-only in one project and read-write in another without conflict.

---

### US9: Automation

A TaskFlow is triggered on a schedule and reports results.

---

### US10: Pause & Resume

A failed TaskFlow is resumed from the point of failure after intervention.

---

## 10. Open Questions (Future Work)

- Native runtime implementation
- Advanced conflict resolution across projects
- Collaborative / multi-user support
- Distributed execution

---

## 11. Success Criteria

Hivemind succeeds if:

- Users trust what agents do
- Failures are explainable
- Parallelism feels safe
- The system remains usable without automation

---

**Hivemind is not an AI that codes.**  
**It is a system that makes agentic work legible, governable,
