## 1. What you’re doing exceptionally well

Let’s start with the positives, because they matter.

### ✅ Clear philosophical spine

Your principles are coherent, non-generic, and consistent:

* Observability
* Determinism
* Human authority
* Local-first
* Replaceable intelligence

This already puts you *above* 90% of AI tooling sites, which are buzzword soup.

### ✅ Strong negative positioning

Lines like:

> No magic.
> No black boxes.
> No surprise merges.

and

> Hivemind is not
> × a chatbot
> × an IDE replacement
> × a model host

are excellent. Keep them.

### ✅ You’re speaking to *experienced* engineers

This line in particular is very good:

> They work great… until they don’t.

That resonates with people who’ve been burned.

---

## 2. The main problem: the “why now?” isn’t sharp enough *early*

Right now, the page **ramps up slowly** into its strongest differentiation.

A first-time visitor skimming the top still might think:

> “Okay… another serious AI dev tool. Maybe a workflow manager?”

You *need* to hit them harder, sooner, with:

> **“This is not for vibe coding.”**

Not as an insult — as a *sorting mechanism*.

---

## 3. How to emphasise “NOT vibe coding” (without saying it awkwardly)

You don’t need to use the phrase “vibe coding” everywhere — but you *should* describe it clearly and reject it explicitly.

### Add a short “Who This Is For / Not For” block EARLY

Right after the hero section, add something like:

---

### Who Hivemind Is For (and Who It Isn’t)

**Hivemind is for:**

* Engineers running non-trivial changes across real codebases
* Long-running or parallel agent workflows
* Situations where failure must be diagnosable and reversible
* Anyone who needs to *trust* automation, not babysit it

**Hivemind is not for:**

* One-shot prompt → code workflows
* Exploratory “vibe coding”
* Auto-merging AI output without review
* Throwaway demos where correctness doesn’t matter

If someone reads this and thinks “that sounds heavy” — **good**.
That’s exactly the filter you want.

---

## 4. Tighten the hero message (small change, big impact)

Current hero:

> Agentic development you can actually trust.

Good — but abstract.

### Slightly sharper version:

> **Agentic development you can actually trust.**
> **When correctness matters more than speed.**

or

> **Agentic development you can actually trust.**
> **For real codebases, real workflows, and real consequences.**

This anchors *why* you exist immediately.

---

## 5. Strengthen the contrast with mainstream tools

Your “Most AI coding tools optimize for speed” section is good, but you can make it punchier by making the contrast *visual and blunt*.

### Suggested tweak:

Instead of:

> Most AI coding tools optimize for speed.
> Hivemind optimizes for correctness, safety, and trust.

Try:

**Most AI coding tools ask:**

> “How fast can we generate code?”

**Hivemind asks:**

> “Can you explain, verify, undo, and trust this change?”

This reframes the problem in a way engineers instantly get.

---

## 6. The “Problem” section is strong — but a bit long

The bullet list is accurate, but you can tighten it to increase punch.

For example, instead of listing *everything*, you could group:

> Today’s AI coding tools:
> — Modify code opaquely
> — Hide context and execution state
> — Break under retries and parallelism
> — Assume humans will clean up the mess

This keeps the message crisp without losing meaning.

---

## 7. Your “Insight” section is excellent — lean into it more

This is one of your best lines:

> The problem isn’t intelligence — it’s orchestration.

That should be **visually dominant**.

Consider making it a standalone callout or oversized quote.

This is a *thesis statement*. Treat it like one.

---

## 8. “How It Works” is solid — one small improvement

The flow is clear, but you can emphasise *irreversibility vs reversibility* more.

Add a line like:

> Every step produces artifacts you can inspect, replay, or roll back.

That reinforces your core promise again.

---

## 9. The differentiation table is good — but rename the column

“Typical AI tools” vs “Hivemind” is fine, but slightly generic.

Consider:

* **Ad-hoc AI coding**
* **Hivemind**

This subtly reinforces that the other side isn’t “competition” — it’s a category you’re deliberately rejecting.

---

## 10. The closing section is philosophically strong, but abstract

This line is good:

> Hivemind isn’t just agent-friendly. It’s agent-operable.

But you might want to end with something *practical* as well.

For example:

> If you’ve ever asked:
> *“What exactly did the agent do?”*
> *“Can I safely undo this?”*
> *“Can I trust this to run again?”*
>
> Hivemind is built for you.

This ties the philosophy back to lived experience.

---

## 11. One sentence you should consider adding verbatim

If you want **one killer line** to kill the vibe-coding confusion, I’d add this somewhere prominent:

> **Hivemind is not about generating code faster.
> It’s about making agentic work safe, inspectable, and governable.**

That sentence alone clarifies *everything*.

---

## Overall verdict (honest)

You’re doing **80–85% of this perfectly already**.

What you need now is not:

* More features
* More explanation
* More cleverness

What you need is:

* **Earlier filtering**
* **Sharper contrast**
* **More “this is NOT for everyone” energy**

That will:

* Attract the right people
* Repel the wrong ones
* And make the right audience feel *seen*

If you want, next I can:

* Rewrite just the hero + first 2 sections for maximum clarity
* Or help you add a short FAQ (“Why not just use Cursor?” etc.)
* Or do a brutal “skim test” for a 10-second reader

But overall — this is already a very serious, credible landing.
